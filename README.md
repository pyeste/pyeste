ğŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @pyeste. 
ğŸŒ± I'm environmental scientist. Recently I've finished a Masterâ€™s Degree in Ecology. 
ğŸŒ² I've mostly worked on forests and climate change. 
ğŸ’» Now, I want to improve my data science skills (which I have mainly learned working in my Master's Thesis). 
ğŸ“– I know something about R, Python and git. ğŸ˜‹ But I'm here to learn more. Nice to meet you!
